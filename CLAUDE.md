# BlackMirrorBikeRide

Notes for the coding agent that works on this repo.

## House standards (shared across every app by this maker)

@../CoworkSyncHub/HOUSE-STANDARDS.md

For this app:
- Check the standards: `node ../CoworkSyncHub/standards.mjs black -v`. Keep it all `ok` before pushing.
- Test: `npm run build` then the scripts/*test.mjs checks listed in .github/workflows/ci.yml
- Deploy: push to main: CI / CD tests, publishes, live-checks and tags
- Work on `main`, push your own work when it passes, and add user-visible changes to `whatsnew.json`.
